1. Terms and Definitions                                                        
                                                                                
1.1. The MutexGear is the MutexGear Library being covered by this License.      
                                                                                
1.2. A Program is a program binary that is either                               
  a. executable on its own and, when executed, causes creation of an operating  
    system process; or                                                          
  b. executable via loading into a container operating system process, provided 
    the purpose of said container operating system process is to serve as a host
    for execution of said program binary and, possibly, other program binaries  
    of the kind for providing features of the operating system by implementing  
    either applets, or services, or drivers, or other operating system          
    components.                                                                 
                                                                                
1.3. A Shared Library is a program binary that contains executable code intended
  for loading into address space of one or more executing Programs, provided    
  some of the executing Programs are not the Shared Library itself.             
                                                                                
1.4. An Exported Function is a part of executable code of a Shared Library,     
  provided said part of executable code is intended for being made directly or  
  indirectly available for invocation from outside of the executable code of    
  the Shared Library as a feature of said Shared Library.                       
                                                                                
2. Grants and Restrictions                                                      
                                                                                
2.1. The MutexGear is permitted to be used, with or without modifications,      
  statically linked within a Program that meets all of the following            
  requirements:                                                                 
  a. the Program is either                                                      
    i. not a Shared Library; or                                                 
    ii. when a purpose of the Program within an operating system requires       
      the Program to also be a Shared Library, the Program as the Shared Library
      must not have other Exported Functions except for those explicitly        
      required by the operating system for fulfilling the purpose;              
  b. use of the Program, and use of the entire software product the Program may 
    be a part of, must be governed by one of the following OSI-approved open    
    source software licenses:

2.2. Alternatively, the MutexGear is permitted to be used, with or without      
  modifications, statically linked within, or in the form of a standalone Shared
  Library dynamically linked with, a Program or a Shared Library that meets all 
  of the following requirements:                                                
  a. use of the Program or the Shared Library must be governed by one of        
    the following OSI-approved open source software licenses:                   
    i. GNU General Public License, version 2
